# This repo contains all problems I've solved during the course.

Course Description:
Almost all other courses focus on knowledge. In this course, we focus on 4 critical skills.

Overall:

The course covers basic to advanced modern C++ syntax. Beginners in C++ will learn a lot!

The course helps you master the 4 most important skills for a programmer

Programming skills

Problem-solving skills: rarely covered by other courses

Project building skills: partially covered by other courses

Design skills: rarely covered by other courses

7+ times practice & homework compare to other courses + 6 projects

Special Teaching style: iterative, easy, and short

This is an English Course only.  1/3 Course now has Manual English subtitles. Remaining under-progress.



Content

Basic to advanced modern C++.

Fundamentals: Variables, Loops, Control Flow, Functions, Recursive Functions, Arrays

Advanced Topics: Pointers, STL, Templates, Headers, and Includes, Exception Handling, Compilation Process, Debugging

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Operator Overloading

Modern Topics in C++11/C++14/C++17:

Move Semantics, Perfect Forwarding, Variadic Template, Folding expressions, Smart Pointers, Lambda Expressions, Wrappers (Optional, Variant, Any), Uniform initialization, noexcept, Structured Binding, Nested namespaces, misc.

OOP: Member initializer, Defaulted and Deleted Functions, Delegating constructors, Inheriting Constructors

STL: Forward list, Initializer list, Array, Unordered containers

Design: Several principles and patterns are embedded in the homework & projects

A huge set of Quizzes, Practice, Homework, and Projects

2 styles of homework: Algorithmic (problem-solving) and applications

Several software design concerns are embedded in the homework.

So you are getting introduced to Software Engineering & Design Patterns

Several quizzes to master the concepts

Clarification: The core intentions of this course to provide very strong introduction to C++. Specifically up to the 6th project. After the last project, the course introduces some further modern C++ syntax (no quizzes/homework in this part). If you are new to C++, there is no course that competes with this one. But, if you are expert or target working with C++ in the market, you will need to good deeper after this course. A useful reference is "C++17 - The Complete Guide" book. Not that, this course provides some C++17 coverage but not all of it. However, the course provides pretty good coverage for C++11/14. Please consider the table of content if you are not new to C++ to satisfy your expectations.



Building Skills: Practice, Homework, and Projects

One unique feature in this course is my education strategy:

Explain, Administrate & Challenge

Each video smoothly explains a simple concept(s)

Typically followed by easy to medium practice to administrate the concept

Then typically followed by an easy-medium-hard set of homework questions to challenge you

Extensive homework from easy to medium to hard to help to build the skills.

Most of the practice/homework questions are unique in this course

Programming questions are mainly from my competitive programming experience

OOP questions are mostly invented to achieve several goals:

Mastering the OOP concepts

Enforcing a lot of design heuristics & OOD

Preparing you for design principles and patterns

Small-to-large set of projects to build up project building and design skills

Solutions to all of them.



By the end of the journey

Solid understanding of programming concepts using C++

Mastering the target 4 skills

With the administered problem-solving skills

You can start competitive programming smoothly in Div2-A/B Codeforces

Smooth start in Data Structure course

Smooth start in Algorithms course

With the administered project-building and design skills

Smooth start in Software Engineering course

Later, smooth start in one of the technology tracks in frontend or backend

More career options such as games or embedded development.

Don't miss such a unique learning experience!
